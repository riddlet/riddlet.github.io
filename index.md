I'm a staff scientist the [National Institute of Mental Health](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/index.shtml) working on the [data science and sharing team](https://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/dsst.html). I'm interested in using my quantitative and computational skills on problems that are meaningful, impactful, and difficult.
